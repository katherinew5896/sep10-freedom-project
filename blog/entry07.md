## context
While giving my **elevator pictches** to my classmates i realized that i needed it to be short but also cover enough basic information about my website i made. I made sure to include sources i used and also a brief description of what my aframe models purpose was. There also had to be a hook to leave people wondering about my topic which was cooking. If my elevator pitch was too long then it might've made the people listening bored. I realized that my energy had to be higher or else it would seem like i hate my project and not be as excited as i shouldve been. 

As for my **presentation** in front of the whole class i also think i needed to add some energy and be less stiff. Being in front of a lot of people is a bit intimidating and is something everyone needs to do in their lifetime. For me its scary when everyone just has a bored look on their face and it feels like theyre judging, but really everyone's in the same boat as i am. For future situations i think i need to make more eye contact and also add some emotion into my voice so it can be a little more interesting for listeners. For my slides i want to make it more fun looking and not a white background.

## sources
1. [Aframe](https://aframe.io/docs/1.5.0/introduction/)-the website really helped me with the coding process since its my first time being exposed to model making in 3d forms so it was good to see detailed explainations from each component and codes to create a model. On the website there were also other peoples models and codes that i could look at and learn about which was very informational.
2. [youtube](youtube.com)-youtube was especially helpful because there were people explaining each different types of codes that i needed for my model and it helped inspire me to make my cooking robot out of cylinders and add animation to invision its robotic use.
