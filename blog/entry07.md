## context
While giving my **elevator pictches** to my classmates i realized that i needed it to be short but also cover enough basic information about my website i made. I made sure to include sources i used and also a brief description of what my aframe models purpose was. There also had to be a hook to leave people wondering about my topic which was cooking. If my elevator pitch was too long then it might've made the people listening bored. I realized that my energy had to be higher or else it would seem like i hate my project and not be as excited as i shouldve been. 

As for my **presentation** in front of the whole class i also think i needed to add some energy and be less stiff. Being in front of a lot of people is a bit intimidating and is something everyone needs to do in their lifetime. For me its scary when everyone just has a bored look on their face and it feels like theyre judging, but really everyone's in the same boat as i am. For future situations i think i need to make more eye contact and also add some emotion into my voice so it can be a little more interesting for listeners. For my slides i want to make it more fun looking and not a white background.

## sources
My [notes](https://docs.google.com/document/d/18sxZghBGbZ9bW4ekC_4aqVdCH-xq2V-Gp5g8KPOXSvY/edit)
My [slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1d_7edsbT0-J64DP0yx-owu56uBBWaEJnBd4Nw74BUtk/edit#slide=id.p)
1. [Aframe](https://aframe.io/docs/1.5.0/introduction/)-the website really helped me with the coding process since its my first time being exposed to model making in 3d forms so it was good to see detailed explainations from each component and codes to create a model. On the website there were also other peoples models and codes that i could look at and learn about which was very informational.
2. [youtube](youtube.com)-youtube was especially helpful because there were people explaining each different types of codes that i needed for my model and it helped inspire me to make my cooking robot out of cylinders and add animation to invision its robotic use.
3. [wireframe](wireframe.cc)- My [wireframe](https://wireframe.cc/PM3ikg) was the first step to planning out my website for how it was going to look in the end. This is very important as my website was needed to showcase my aframe. I needed to incorporate my creativity into the wireframes to grasp an idea of what my final design was going to look like. It was also helpful looking at my classmates wireframes to see what mistakes they made and improve mine as well.

## skills
1. one skill i have improved on was my planning, this was very much needed as in my past projects i relied on pure luck to come up with something on the spot and try and make everything come together. While making my wireframe i had an idea while browsing on different websites and looked at which format was good. Obviously i didnt want a bunch of information stuffed into my website, but i also didnt want to have too much blank space. Also planning my website i wanted to add some components so it could be better.
2. another skill i learned was communication. As i realized quite many people were also doing the topic of cooking and so i asked what they had planned for their models as a way to gain knowledge and inspiration. Ultimatly i had decided on a cooking robot because of the amount of AI presence consuming our world right now. It would make sense to have a moving robot like in the movies that do things for you.
3. third skill i learned was public speaking. After presenting in front of the whole class i realized that i needed some more energy in me and to present my project to reflect the amount of time i used on it. While presenting in the expo i used my experience from presenting in the class with the judges and added more enthusiasm so i didn't sound like a robot myself. It is important to also be proud of what you have rather then hating it because something is better than nothing.

## EDP 
Currently i am on the 8th step which is communication of my results. After a whole year of learning different codes and expanding my creativity, i have used a good amount of it in my website for my final project which also included my aframe. I have used components i learned from bootstrap and aframe and also other things like containers/or fluids. Implimenting my aframe was also a bit difficult as it was my first time doing it but with research and time i figured it out. My [website](https://katherinew5896.github.io/sep10-freedom-project/) is informational yet it is not too cramped up and filled with tons of things.

## Overview
During the first year of SEP this freedom project was to expand our 10th grade minds and make something from scratch that we learned during the whole year. It is to make a website and model that we were proud of for the future of technology. As my topic suggests cooking is a very improtant invention since ancient times for survival. As such it will also be incorporated into technology for many years to come as it already has. When it comes to technology we also want to use it to make our lives easier when it comes to everyday things. The idea of a robot being in your home may sound scary as movies show robots going berserk when the coding is off and it gains a mind of its own. That is one negative possibility, but we can also add safety features to them like how we use heaters, stoves, microwaves, ovens, and etc. Globally it has changed many lives around the world and mostly everyone uses them to create a economic rise for items similar to cooking robots. This can positively impact the enviorment as cooking robots only needs electricity for it to run and not gas/fuel. My invention can help many people around the world socially for people who may be disabled or dont know how to cook. It can be a very helpful hand for citizens and can change the world.
