## context
While giving my **elevator pictches** to my classmates i realized that i needed it to be short but also cover enough basic information about my website i made. I made sure to include sources i used and also a brief description of what my aframe models purpose was. There also had to be a hook to leave people wondering about my topic which was cooking. If my elevator pitch was too long then it might've made the people listening bored. I realized that my energy had to be higher or else it would seem like i hate my project and not be as excited as i shouldve been. 

As for my **presentation** in front of the whole class i also think i needed to add some energy and be less stiff. Being in front of a lot of people is a bit intimidating and is something everyone needs to do in their lifetime. For me its scary when everyone just has a bored look on their face and it feels like theyre judging, but really everyone's in the same boat as i am. For future situations i think i need to make more eye contact and also add some emotion into my voice so it can be a little more interesting for listeners. For my slides i want to make it more fun looking and not a white background.

## sources
1. [Aframe](https://aframe.io/docs/1.5.0/introduction/)-the website really helped me with the coding process since its my first time being exposed to model making in 3d forms so it was good to see detailed explainations from each component and codes to create a model. On the website there were also other peoples models and codes that i could look at and learn about which was very informational.
2. [youtube](youtube.com)-youtube was especially helpful because there were people explaining each different types of codes that i needed for my model and it helped inspire me to make my cooking robot out of cylinders and add animation to invision its robotic use.
3. [wireframe](wireframe.cc)-wireframe was the first step to planning out my website for how it was going to look in the end. This is very important as my website was needed to showcase my aframe. I needed to incorporate my creativity into the wireframes to grasp an idea of what my final design was going to look like. It was also helpful looking at my classmates wireframes to see what mistakes they made and improve mine as well.

## skills
1. one skill i have improved on was my planning, this was very much needed as in my past projects i relied on pure luck to come up with something on the spot and try and make everything come together. While making my wireframe i had an idea while browsing on different websites and looked at which format was good. Obviously i didnt want a bunch of information stuffed into my website, but i also didnt want to have too much blank space. Also planning my website i wanted to add some components so it could be better.
2. another skill i learned was communication. As i realized quite many people were also doing the topic of cooking and so i asked what they had planned for their models as a way to gain knowledge and inspiration. Ultimatly i had decided on a cooking robot because of the amount of AI presence consuming our world right now. It would make sense to have a moving robot like in the movies that do things for you.
3. third skill i learned was public speaking. After presenting in front of the whole class i realized that i needed some more energy in me and to present my project to reflect the amount of time i used on it. While presenting in the expo i used my experience from presenting in the class with the judges and added more enthusiasm so i didn't sound like a robot myself. It is important to also be proud of what you have rather then hating it because something is better than nothing.

## EDP 
Currently i am on the 8th step which is communication of my results. After a whole year of learning different codes and expanding my creativity, i have used a good amount of it in my website for my final project which also included my aframe. I have used components i learned from bootstrap and aframe and also other things like containers/or fluids. Implimenting my aframe was also a bit difficult as it was my first time doing it but with research and time i figured it out. My website is informational yet it is not too cramped up and filled with tons of things.
