## context
While giving my elevator pictches to my classmates i realized that i needed it to be short but also cover enough basic information about my website i made. I made sure to include sources i used and also a brief description of what my aframe models purpose was. There also had to be a hook to leave people wondering about my topic which was cooking. If my elevator pitch was too long then it might've made the people listening bored. I realized that my energy had to be higher or else it would seem like i hate my project and not be as excited as i shouldve been.
