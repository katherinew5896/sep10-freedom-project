## Context
For blog 3 I am brainstorming about the past, present, and future of software and hardware in my topic of cooking. While brainstorming about how technology has been used in the past, I can make ideas on what advancements may come in the near future.

## Ideas
### [Future inventions in Cooking](https://www.partstown.com/about-us/cooking-technology-trends-2024#:~:text=Newer%20appliances%20like%20ovens%20and,can%20have%20their%20own%20setting.)  
* **Smart stove/pot**  
    * Stove/pot that could help time and manage your cooking  
    * Stove can turn off when it has to if you're away  
    * Pot can have some internal stirring option so food doesn't stick  
* **Advanced Cooking app**  
    * Generates recipes based on what ingredients you have on hand  
    * Provides measurements and items needed for recipe

## EDP
I am currently in the  3rd step of Brainstorming where my goal is to figure out how Hardware and Software may impact cooking in the near future. For my website I want it to accurately show recipes and show accurate measuring while cooking. My website will also have an AI bot to help communicate with people on how to better their cooking and improve.

## Skills
**Communication** I learned how to communicate with my peers on how to research better and to also look deeper into different links and websites. This is very helpful because I can get extra help from my friends and make my work better and detailed. Improving this skill can create connections with people and make friendships. We friends can also help each other with difficulties.

**How to [Google](https://www.google.com/)** will help me a lot with finding ideas and knowledge about Hardwares and softwares in cooking. For future ideas it is helpful since I can read different sources from anywhere about AI and future technology. By improving this skill I can gather information on the future faster, but also look at old documents that have been written down.
