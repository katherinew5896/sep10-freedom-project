## Advancements
My topic involves technology that has been incorperated into cooking. Many different technological advances have been made to make growing food and also safely consuming products. To demontrate, [this website](https://www.startus-insights.com/innovators-guide/top-10-food-technology-trends-innovations-in-2021/) helps us with keeping track and informing people of future innovations that may positively impact our world for the better. It talks of how to provide better nutrients and a better way of operating in kicthens. Different countries like Korea have been starting to open kitchens that are basically data-driven planning services that provide cleaner eating enviorments and also faster paced with cooking.

## EDP
One of many problems have yet to be solved, but the first step is to acknowledge these problems and thoroughly look for smart solutions. The problem i hope to solve is making sure that <b>everyone</b> is able to eat good food and enjoy it knowing that its good for their growth. Making sure that products or resources are not contaminated and can cause illness is very important. [This website](https://www.food-safety.com/articles/7927-advances-in-digital-technologies-for-food-safety) explains how we are working to produce safer resources with items such as bluetooth measuring the temperature of cargos without opening them.

## Skills
### How to Google
There are many ways to get information and to learn, but one of the main ways is [Google](https://www.google.com/webhp?hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjUzMey8eyCAxUcmYkEHWNvA8EQPAgJ), since its such a big platform with thousands and millions of websites, it has been helpful to read the technological advancements that have been made over the years. Tons of research that are stored into Google can be very helpful. Learning how to Google needs keywords like <b>Technology, Tech,Advancements,Robot, etc</b> when talking about engineering.

### Communication
While researching i've noticed that communication was a very important part because to work together is to communicate. We need to communicate in order to make changes while advancing in technology. Communication is how we share ideas and knowledge with one another.


## summary
Overall, i think that we should take careful steps to enforce these techological advances to producing a healthier enviorment for everyone. I got my inspiration from taking care of onesself with creating a healthier mindset and it starts with eating better and feeling better.
