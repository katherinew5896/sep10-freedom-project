# Entry 6
##### 5/1/24

## context
I made my MVP by first starting with the more challenging part--the aframe model because i needed to make it look alright but also it being in my capabilites. I used the aframe website and youtube videos to help me put together the codes for my robot that is made out of squares, cylinders, and circles. There is also a background kitchen model that consists of rectangles and boxes. After I finished my robot model I continued with my website and put together my wireframe desktop idea. I used the navabar for the lists of things in my website. Another probelem i had was when i added my aframe into my website it took out a chunk of my bottom codes. I think it came out pretty accurate to my wireframe and it is not the worst thng. Personally i need to work on my time management since i couldve done more and a better job. 

#### My plan and wireframe

* containers/columns

### Challenges while making my MVP
Making my aframe- One challenge i faced while making my mvp was making the aframe look to what i had imagined with the code i had learned from sources. This was a challenge because i wanted my aframe robot to look good but with just very simple shapes i learned. Also i had a hard time understanding the mechanics of making the robot move back and forth. But i just tried my best since this is more of practice for me to improve later on.

Aframe destorying my website-Once i had finished adding components to my website and adding text into it, i finally added my aframe but when i viewed my website after it had gotten rid some of my extra information towards the bottom and i had to figure out what i was missing from my html that was in the way of my code disappearing. After thinking a lot and asking my friends i finally fixed my code by adding `<iframe></iframe>`
````
<div class="container">
  <div class="row ">

<div class="col purple">
  <iframe src= aframe.html class= "aframe">
    </iframe>
</div>
````
After i added the iframe my code worked out fine and everything remained seen.
### Takeaways from making my MVP

Try out codes-At first i wanted everything to look perfect and my codes work well and was scared of making mistakes i couldn't change but quickly realized that making a mistake was a process of improving throughout my project and that testing different codes to see what they would look like helped me a lot with how i wanted my final website to look like. It is very important to try out random codes and see which one is perfect for you and what works as well. It was quite difficult figuring out what to do when my code was bugging out and after testing it, it worked in the end.

Plan before making a webiste-

  
## Sources
One source i found was this [website](https://www.8thwall.com/8thwall/animation-mixer-aframe/code/assets/robot.glb) that had a robot made from aframe and i got inspiration from this aframe. Also for aframe I found websites that teach me how Aframe works like ["Aframe youtube"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4LEMBjaV9E&list=PL8MkBHej75fJD-HveDzm4xKrciC5VfYuV&index=6) and ["Aframe website"](https://aframe.io/docs/1.5.0/introduction/javascript-events-dom-apis.html) which helped me made a robot that I need to improve. Other websites that I used that helped during my MVP was wireframe without wireframe I wouldn't have a plan ["Mobile"](https://wireframe.cc/Xlfyih) and ["Desktop"](https://wireframe.cc/PM3ikg) I also add bootstrap to my project which I learned using there website ["Bootstrap webiste"](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.3/getting-started/introduction/) combining all of these websites I started to make my website.


## EDP
I am on the 6 and 7 step of EDP. Which step 6 is Test and evaluate the prototype and step 7 is Improve as needed. 

## Skills
1. one skill I learned was to not be afraid to ask my classmates because i am shy and dont ask for help as much as i should. I realized how important this skill is due to me improving from my peers comments and feedbacks on my work. It is important to build relationships to kind of help give you a push when you need it.
2. I also learned how to build an aframe model from the geometric shapes. I made my own little robot with cylinders and made it walk forward over and over again.
3. The last skill I learned was planning
