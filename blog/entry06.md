# Entry 6
##### 5/1/24

## context
I made my MVP by first starting with the more challenging part--the aframe model because i needed to make it look alright but also it being in my capabilites. I used the aframe website and youtube videos to help me put together the codes for my robot that is made out of squares, cylinders, and circles. There is also a background kitchen model that consists of rectangles and boxes. After I finished my robot model I continued with my website and put together my wireframe desktop idea. I used the navabar for the lists of things in my website. Another probelem i had was when i added my aframe into my website it took out a chunk of my bottom codes. I think it came out pretty accurate to my wireframe and it is not the worst thng. Personally i need to work on my time management since i couldve done more and a better job. 

#### My plan and wireframe

##### Wireframes

##### Timeline
* 4/15-4/18 plan out my steps
* 4/18 tinker more with aframe and components.. maybe try out some new ones
* 4/19-5/1 start coding and finishing my model

##### components
* navbar
* card
* containers/columns

### Challenges while making my MVP
As I said before I faced different chanllenges some of which is:

Making my aframe-

Aframe destorying my website-


### Takeaways from making my MVP

Try out codes-

Plan before making a webiste-

## EDP
I am on the 6 and 7 step of EDP. Which step 6 is Test and evaluate the prototype and step 7 is Improve as needed. 

## Skills
1. one skill I learned was to not be afraid to ask my classmates because i am shy and dont ask for help as much as i should. I realized how important this skill is due to me improving from my peers comments and feedbacks on my work. It is important to build relationships to kind of help give you a push when you need it. 
2. I also learned how to build an aframe model from the geometric shapes. I made my own little robot with cylinders and made it walk forward over and over again.

3.The last skill I learned was planning
