## context
I made my MVP by firs starting with the more challenging part--the aframe model because i needed to make it look alright but also it being in my capabilites. I used the aframe website and youtube videos to help me put together the codes for my robot that is made out of squares, cylinders, and circles. There is also a background kitchen model that consists of rectangles and boxes. After I finished my robot model I continued with my website and put together my wireframe desktop idea. I used the navabar for the lists of things in my website. Another probelem i had was when i added my aframe into my website it took out a chunk of my bottom codes. I think it came out pretty accurate to my wireframe and it is not the worst thng. Personally i need to work on my time management since i couldve done more and a better job.
