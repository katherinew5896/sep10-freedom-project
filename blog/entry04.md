## Context
This step was about choosing what tools we wanted to use and i decided to use AFrame. Aframe is a framework for building most VR(virual reality) which includes 3d models of items or people. I found some resources to help me in this project with the [aframe](https://aframe.io/) website. Another website i used was [youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ktjMCanKNLk&list=PL8MkBHej75fJD-HveDzm4xKrciC5VfYuV) where there was a whole playlist about aframe and its use.

## Basics 
There are many shapes you could add like boxes, cylinders, squares, and circles.  
**Box** `<a-entity geometry="primitive: box; width: 1; height: 1; depth: 1"></a-entity>`  
**circle** `<a-entity geometry="primitive: circle; radius: 1" material="side: double"></a-entity>`  
**cylinder** `<a-entity geometry="primitive: cylinder; height: 3; radius: 2"></a-entity>`
