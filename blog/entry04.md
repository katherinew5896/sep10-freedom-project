## Context
This step was about choosing what tools we wanted to use and i decided to use AFrame. Aframe is a framework for building most VR(virual reality) which includes 3d models of items or people. I found some resources to help me in this project with the [aframe](https://aframe.io/) website. Another website i used was [youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ktjMCanKNLk&list=PL8MkBHej75fJD-HveDzm4xKrciC5VfYuV) where there was a whole playlist about aframe and its use.

## Basics 
There are many shapes you could add like boxes, cylinders, squares, and circles.  
**Box** `<a-entity geometry="primitive: box; width: 1; height: 1; depth: 1"></a-entity>`  

**circle** `<a-entity geometry="primitive: circle; radius: 1" material="side: double"></a-entity>`  

**cylinder** `<a-entity geometry="primitive: cylinder; height: 3; radius: 2"></a-entity>`  


## How to add aframe into your HTML
To add aframe into HTML you can implant this code from the aframe website to your HTML.  
`<html >
  <head >
    <script src="https://aframe.io/releases/1.5.0/aframe.min.js"></script>
  </head >
  <body >
    <a-scene >
    </a-scene >
  </body 
</html >`
