            <p>Cooking is like an art, it is the pratice/skill of preparing food by mixing, combining and heating stuff together. It has been around for more than 2 million years ago. There are many problems that you can face when cooking, like have you ever felt too lazy to cook, I sure have. I sometimes am too lazy and just eat cup noodles, but I also worry about my health and want a good meal. So I want to make a robot to do everything for me.</p>

            <p>Think of a world where you don't have to cook anymore, you can have a robot. That is the world I am dreaming of, if we can have a world with robots to do everything, but my first step is trying to make a cooking robot. I used Aframe to show what a robot can do in helping us cook, you will find out more as you go through the software and hardware and later in this website you will see my Aframe of my robot cooking.</p>

                  <p class="card-text">Hardware in cooking is very important because many items we use for cooking is hardware and is to mke our lives easier when it comes to cooking. I think that hardware can really help with time management since not everyone has all the time in the world. Personally I think having children and having jobs is very hard and having something like a robot can definetly help with cooking.</p>
